Hi there!!
I got some error that "couldn't commit becuase of index.lock file.. something like that". Know i'm gonna tell how i could resolve that
error. Here we go..!
I first opened that learning GIT folder then I right clcked and opened "customize this folder" then "general" then there's a option
"Hidden" there ticked it and clicked "apply". U will be able to see .git file there open it then delete index.lock file in it. Now try to
commit the changes in vs code 

its time to watch "Molkki" now. Hehehe....

Its 9/2/22 today. I'm back after so long...

A new day again...12/2/22
