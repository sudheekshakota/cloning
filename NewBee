Hi there!!
I got some error that "couldn't commit becuase of index.lock file.. something like that". Know i'm gonna tell how i could resolve that
error. Here we go..!
I first opened that learning GIT folder then I right clcked and opened "customize this folder" then "general" then there's a option
"Hidden" there ticked it and clicked "apply". U will be able to see .git file there open it then delete index.lock file in it. Now try to
commit the changes in vs code
